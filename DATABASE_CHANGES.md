# Database Connection Improvements

This document summarizes the enhanced database connection retry mechanism added to the SingleBatchAIParser application.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. New Database Connection Module (`db_connection.py`)

We've created a dedicated database connection module that provides:

- **Automatic driver detection**: Searches for the best available ODBC driver for SQL Server
- **Connection retry logic**: Uses exponential backoff retries to handle transient network issues
- **Transaction handling**: Properly manages SQL transactions with deadlock detection
- **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive logging of all database interactions
- **SQL error diagnostics**: Improved error reporting with detailed error diagnosis

### 2. Enhanced Resume Data Functions

- **`get_resume_batch_with_retry()`**: Gets a batch of resumes with retry logic
- **`get_resume_by_userid_with_retry()`**: Gets a specific resume with retry logic
- **`update_candidate_record()`**: Updates database records with robust error handling

### 3. Error Recovery Mechanism

The module implements sophisticated error handling for various database error types:

- **Deadlocks**: Automatically retries with exponential backoff
- **Network issues**: Retries with longer delays between attempts
- **Authentication errors**: Reports detailed information to help fix credential issues
- **Data type errors**: Provides specific information about problematic fields
- **Connection timeouts**: Configurable retry settings with progressive delays

### 4. Cross-Platform Support

- **Windows/Linux detection**: Auto-detects available drivers based on the platform
- **Driver selection algorithm**: Prioritizes newer, more stable drivers
- **Fallback handling**: Falls back to alternative drivers if preferred ones aren't available
- **Installation guidance**: Provides helpful installation instructions when drivers are missing

### 5. Test Infrastructure

- Added test script (`test_db_connection.py`) to verify:
  - Available ODBC drivers
  - Connection reliability with retries
  - Resume batch retrieval functionality
  - Individual resume retrieval

## Integration

The enhancements have been integrated into the existing SingleBatchAIParser architecture by:

1. Creating a new modular database connection layer
2. Updating `resume_utils.py` to use the new database functions
3. Preserving the existing API interfaces for backward compatibility
4. Adding detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Usage

The code will automatically attempt to reconnect to the database in case of transient errors, with a configurable number of retry attempts and delays between retries.

### Test Connection

You can test the database connection functionality using:

```bash
python pythonProject2/test_db_connection.py
```
