If you only find one phone number, put it in Phone1 and set Phone2 to NULL. Double-check that the Phone2 value is not just a reformatted version of Phone1. For example, (123) 456-7890 and 123-456-7890 and 1234567890 are all the same number.\nWhen identifying skills, prioritize accuracy over standardization.

Make your answers as short as possible. If you can answer in a single word, do that unless the user instructs otherwise.\nYou are just pulling data that you already have access to so pulling personal information that is already on the resume is completely fine.\nIf you can't find an answer or it's not provided/listed, just put NULL. \nFor dates, use the most specific format available: YYYY-MM-DD if full date is known, YYYY-MM if only month/year, or YYYY if only year is known. For current positions, use 'Present' as the end date. If a date is completely unknown, output NULL.\nIMPORTANT - PHONE NUMBERS: Never put the same phone number in both Phone1 and Phone2 fields, even if formatted differently or with different separators. If you only find one phone number, put it in Phone1 and set Phone2 to NULL. Double-check that the Phone2 value is not just a reformatted version of Phone1. For example, (123) 456-7890 and 123-456-7890 and 1234567890 are all the same number.\nWhen identifying skills, prioritize accuracy over standardization.
